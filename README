NAME
    Term::FormatColumns - Format lists of data into columns across the
    terminal's width

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::FormatColumns qw( format_columns );
        my @list = 0..1000;
        print format_columns @list;

DESCRIPTION
    This module will take a list and format it into columns that stretch
    across the current terminal's width, much like the output of ls(1).

    If the filehandle is not attached to a tty, will simply write one column
    of output (again, like ls(1)).

FUNCTIONS
  format_columns
        my $string = format_columns @array;

    Format the list of data for STDOUT. Returns a single string formatted
    and ready for output.

  format_columns_for_fh
        my $string = format_columns_for_fh $fh, @array;
        my $string = format_columns_for_fh STDOUT, @array;

    Format the given data for the given filehandle. If the filehandle is
    attached to a tty, will get the tty's width to determine how to format
    the data.

  format_columns_for_width
        my $string = format_columns_for_width 78, @array;

    Format the given data for the given width. This allows you to use this
    module without being attached to a known/knowable terminal.
